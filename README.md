# Building-A-Computer-From-First-Principles
 Building a modern computer from first principles

This is a project I have started to practice of bit of VHDL whilst revising computer architecture and gradually learning about compilers and operating systems. 

Firstly I'll focus on building the hardware platform of a simpler computer. After that I aim to create a mult-tier software heiarchy, with the end goal of making my own object-based programming language and my own operating system. Essentialy, I am starting with simple logic and abstracting further anf further.
